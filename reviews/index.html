<div class="itemtext">
	<p>Watching a band grow itself from the ground up means progress markers and milestones, and Boston’s Matt Germak Band is just approaching the point where audiences of family, friends, and friends of friends have begun to snowball into real word-of-mouth buzz.</p>
	<p>[snip] …</p>
	<p>“We’ve had him here a couple times before and he’s grown into a better player &#8211; tighter, better sounding,” Harpers general manager Andrew Wolan said. “He’s got that catchy, piano-driven rock thing and people like it.”<br />

<p><span class="chronodata">published: 2006.05</span></p>

<div class="itemtext">
	<p>After contributing to a compilation album, The Burren Project, in 2004, the Matt Germak Band recently released its own EP, Strangest Days, featuring three original songs. They are known for their intriguing live sound played across the Boston area.</p>
	<p>Described as a rock/pop funk band, the Matt Germak Band displays a diverse, upbeat sound by incorporating jazzy piano mixed with a contemporary pop style of songwriting. The three-piece opener, “Stripped Away,” displays intense piano playing that builds up to Germak’s unique sounding vocals and slightly off-kilter tone&#8230;The last track, “Strangest Days,” has a catchier beat than the first two. Germak’s voice blends in better with the music, which helps draw more focus to the sensitive lyrics. The ending’s fade out is an effective conclusion to the last track on the EP.</p>
	<p>The Matt Germak Band is still on the rise, performing more live shows and gathering a larger following&#8230;their determination is promising. As with many contemporary bands, sometimes you have to see a live performance to really hear the music.<br />

<h4>Dissolver Magazine &#8211; Review of “Strangest Days”</h4>

<p><span class="chronodata">published: 2006.05.15</span></p>

<div class="itemtext">
	<p>I’m a sap for any band that throws in something random, something you don’t hear in most bands. matt pond PA has that cello, most good Irish rock bands have an accordion somewhere in there, and Something Corporate has that raging piano. The Matt Germak Band follows the latter and comes up with some kicking piano licks, really grabbing a hold of any synapses firing in your brain and just hanging on for dear life. I myself was pretty much reduced to having my eyes glaze over and my head bob during those piano intros. Hell, you could have packaged me in plastic and set me on a store counter next to Ichiro and Piazza bobblehead dolls, and I’d have fit right in. I probably wouldn’t have noticed, either.</p>
	<p>All in all, this band has a decent sound that will get better. I do think they’ll make something of this if they keep their minds to it&#8230;<br />

<p><span class="chronodata">published: 2006.05.05</span></p>

<div class="itemtext">
	<p>The piano lead in to “Stripped Away” from this Boston band evokes Coldplay. Then Matt’s voice kicks in, slightly reminiscent of Midnight Oil’s Peter Garrett. The music stays with the piano as the focal instrument, driving a pop machine that also has a waft of a Bruce Hornsby feel while remaining a bit edgy. A bit raw, but in the three tracks, you can feel something is happening here.</p>

<h4><acronym title="Harvard's JFK School of Government student newspaper">The Citizen</acronym> &#8211; Review of “Strangest Days”</h4>

<p><span class="chronodata">published: 2006.04.20</span></p>

<div class="itemtext">
	<p>“Strangest Days” is the new EP from Matt Germak Band, a Berklee student four-piece, with an innovative marketing strategy which includes approaching student papers for a CD review; The Citizen gladly took on the task. With piano hooks reminiscent of Coldplay and the upbeat rock lightness of Gavin McGraw, the songs leave you wanting to hear more. This is a band that is obviously very strong in song-writing, as shown by the catchy “Stripped Away” and “Leave This Train Behind,”&#8230;word on the street is that they have a strong live gig following and fill the room with their tunes. And this Boston-based band certainly seems to be going places; with their savvy business sense, sassy business cards and a cool EP photo in the mix, they have a lot going for them.</p>

<h4>The Patriot Ledger &#8211; Review of “Strangest Days,”</h4>

<p><span class="chronodata">published: 2006.02</span></p>

<div class="itemtext">
	<p>Bred during its members’ time at Berklee School of Music, the Matt Germak Band is well aware of how delectable a cascading rock piano matched with a locked-in rhythm section can be when applied to snappy funk pop&#8230;Germak himself is a stellar keyboard stylist, and each of the three songs on this test-the-waters sampler disc is potential-packed.</p>
	<p>“Stripped Away” and “Leave This Train Behind” leave less of an impression than the closer, “Strangest Days,” which offers stronger lyrics and a meatier backbone that better serve Germak’s ambitions. A full length album will hopefully reveal a broader range, and streamable MP3s on the band’s Web site (mattgermak.com) of additional songs suggest so. Ben Folds comparisons are going to dog Germak as his group cultivates a fan base, but that’s a good thing: Where piano rockers are concerned, we could all use more effervescent Ben Folds and less droning Coldplay.<br />

<h4>What other musicians have to say:</h4>

<div class="itemtext">
	<p>Christie Leigh, CNC Music Productions</p>
	<blockquote><p>Matt Germak Band is definitely a band to watch. They have a great sound, well-written songs and the ability to fill a room with ease.&nbsp; Keep your eyes on this band.</p></blockquote>

	<p>Sammy James &#8211; Producer, Engineer, Musician</p>

	<blockquote><p>Matt is an excellent musician. His rock-solid piano chops and his effortless baritone put him way ahead of Five For Fighting and Ben Folds. Pass this one up at your own peril.</p></blockquote>
